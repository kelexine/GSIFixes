## GSIFixes for Transsion Devices 

This project was initially started by @SOUROVKHANNAHID as a magisk module for Infinix HOT 11S to improve vendor and fix bugs after flashing GSI Roms.

Tested on infinix hot 11s (both NFC and non NFC) | Tecno Spark 8 series and other some other Transsion devices with similar problems.

Although it has been tested on the above phones i still don't guarantee that it works for you so use it at your own risk.
